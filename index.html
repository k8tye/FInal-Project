        <p class="blocktext-long">Not only do I have 20 years of experience as a Graphic Designer, but I also have a long history in business branding, advertising, and content writing. I specialize in conceptualizing designs and executing ideas in a clear, concise manner. Attention to detail, organization, and good communication are valuable characteristics that I strive to perfect not only professionally but also personally. As a strong team player and leader, I take instruction well, value critiques, positively inspire others around me, and implement an attitude of collaboration and cooperation in all situations. I thrive in fast-paced and professional environment with likeminded creative, abstract thinkers.</p>
